        <h2>Development Experience</h2>
        <hr>
        <h5>Front End Web Development Student <small> (February 2017 - August 2017)</small></h5>
        <h6>
          The Iron Yard is a 24-week immersive code school. The program started with HTML and CSS, then moved into JavaScript, frameworks, and APIs while designing single page apps. The coursework mimics fast-paced, on the job learning with a focus on product development. The Iron Yard finished with learning React as a framework for JavaScript
        </h6>
        <h5><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-four-lib">NPM Library for Connect Four Board Game</a> <small> single page app</small></h5>
        <h6>
          This was a group project that the whole class worked on. It uses only Javascript in order to tell when a user has successfully connected four of their same pieces. It creates an empty board for the user. I was in charge if figuring out how to get the board to detect if a row was the winner.
        </h6>
        <h5><a href="http://connect-four-app.surge.sh/">Connect Four</a> <small> single page app</small></h5>
        <h6>
          This connect four project was built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and it is responsive. It uses only functional, stateless components, and only has one state object. The game detects when a game has been won or ends in a draw by using the NPM libaray that the class created.
        </h6>
        <h5><a href="https://mikestegall.github.io/restaurant-group-project/">Burrito Boys</a> <small> single page app</small></h5>
        <h6>
          Burrito Boys is my Iron Yard midterm group project. It is a Mexican restaurant website mock-up using HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX. I was the team leader in charge of assigning my team members with tasks that they could do but were still challenging for them to do as well. What I did for this project was connecting to the Flickr API, connect to the custom resturant API that The Iron Yard setup for us, and style the website and help out my team mates when they needed help with their tasks.
        </h6>
        <h5><a href="http://github-api-app.surge.sh/">GitHub Username Search</a> <small> single page app</small></h5>
        <h6>
          The GitHub API clone was the first React project that we did using React as a framework for Javascript. It uses only functional components with only one state object. It detects the username that you type in and will tell you their name, a link to their GitHub Profile, a link to their blog, their location, and if they are hireable.
        </h6>
        <h5><a href="https://mikestegall.github.io/color-clock/">Color Clock</a> <small> single page app</small></h5>
        <h6>
          The color clock project was one of my first projects where I started putting everything together. I combined approaches of CSS layout, animation, and transitions. I broke down a simple process of mathematical steps into a series of statements in JavaScript. Demonstrated functional programming methods and use of DOM APIâ€™s.
        </h6>
        <h5><a href="https://mikestegall.github.io/calculator/">Calculator</a> <small> single page app</small></h5>
        <h6>
          The calculator project was built using divs instead of buttons. Also did not use .eval() for the entire assignment. This project helped me understand state better.
