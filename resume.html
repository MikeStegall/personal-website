        <h2>Development Experience</h2>
        <hr>
        <h5>Front End Web Development Student <small> (February 2017 - August 2017)</small></h5>
        <h6>
          The Iron Yard is a 24-week immersive code school. The program started with HTML and CSS, then moved into JavaScript, frameworks, and APIs while designing single page apps. The coursework mimics fast-paced, on the job learning with a focus on product development.
        </h6>
        <h5><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-four-lib">NPM Library for Connect Four Board Game</a></h5>
        <h6>
          This was a group project that the whole class worked on. It uses only Javascript in order to tell when a user has successfully connected four of their same pieces. It creates an empty board for the user. I was in charge of figuring out how to get the board to detect if a row was the winner.
        </h6>
        <h5><a href="http://connect-four-app.surge.sh/">Connect Four</a> <small> single page app</small></h5>
        <h6>
          This connect four project was built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and it is responsive. It uses only functional, stateless components, and only has one state object. The game detects when a game has been won or ends in a draw by using the NPM library that the class created.
        </h6>
        <h5><a href="http://it-maintenance.surge.sh/">Scheduled Maintenance</a> <small> single page app</small></h5>
        <h6>
          This project is built with React, Firebase, Mori, and Ratchet for styling. This is my final project for The Iron Yard. It is a mobile web application mostly to be used when a computer technician goes to clients places of work and checks on their computers. It is an 11 point check list that you go through for every computer. You can view a spread sheet of the job on a computer screen.
        </h6>
        <h5><a href="http://github-api-app.surge.sh/">GitHub Username Search</a> <small> single page app</small></h5>
        <h6>
          The GitHub API clone was the first React project that we did using React as a framework for Javascript. It uses only functional components with only one state object. It detects the username that you type in and will tell you their name, a link to their GitHub Profile, a link to their blog, their location, and if they are hireable.
        </h6>
        <h5><a href="https://mikestegall.github.io/color-clock/">Color Clock</a> <small> single page app</small></h5>
        <h6>
          The color clock project was one of my first projects where I started putting everything together. I combined approaches of CSS layout, and animation. I broke down a simple process of mathematical steps into a series of statements in JavaScript. Demonstrated functional programming methods and use of DOM APIâ€™s.
        </h6>
        <h5><a href="https://mikestegall.github.io/calculator/">Calculator</a> <small> single page app</small></h5>
        <h6>
          The calculator project was built using divs instead of buttons. Also did not use .eval() for the entire assignment. This project helped me understand state better.
